# Bank App Luca

## Description:
This project is the capstone full-stack project for the MIT course I took in 2021-2022. It shows my growth as a full-stack programmer and portrays a very simple and well made example of a MERN app.

## Install:
After downloading the project and running npm install, you can start the development server with node index.js which will host a local website that also connects to the data base hosted on Mongo Atlas.
